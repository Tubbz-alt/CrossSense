# Instructions for obtaining the dataset
We are happy to relase our dataset for research purpose. Please follow the instructions given in the [CrossSense dataset agreement](https://github.com/nwuzj/CrossSense/blob/master/documentation/Dataset%20Release%20Agreement.pdf) to gain access to our dataset. 


Additional Notes:
As we declared in the paper, we collected about 100 volunteers' data. Some graduated volunteers who severed in the Security Agencies require us not to open these datasets (which are considered high-security level privacy). They believe that opening these privacy datasets (raw datasets) is not legitimate, although we explain these data can only be used to do research. And the institute also officially told us the possible risks and asked us to resubmit IRB new application.
 
Under pressure, we have to choose to open most part datasets as possible as we can.  We hope that you can currently understand the volunteers' concerns about digital privacy and strict security control policy.  
 
So, we will change the claim in the site.
